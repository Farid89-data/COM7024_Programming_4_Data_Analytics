RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ESTATE MANAGER
================================================================================
1. WATERFRONT INVESTMENT: Properties with waterfront access command a 90.8% premium and represent
   only 0.8% of the market, indicating a specialized niche opportunity.

2. SPACE OPTIMIZATION: Floor space is a critical value driver. Renovation projects targeting additional
   square footage could yield significant returns based on the strong correlation (r=0.688).

3. MARKET SEGMENTATION: Build year influences pricing, suggesting market preferences for newer construction.
   Properties from different decades may appeal to different buyer segments.

4. DATA QUALITY: The preprocessing pipeline successfully handled 23 
   data quality issues, ensuring reliable analysis for forecasting models.

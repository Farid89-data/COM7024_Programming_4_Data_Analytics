Task 1.2: Data Analysis in Python,70,Exemplary technical understanding and judgement of python processes within a data science environment,"An outstanding  understanding of the  \nprocesses involved when conducting  data analysis in python.  \nData importing, \npre-processing and  descriptive statistics have  \nall been completed correctly. \nCorrect coding conventions have been applied.  \nAll processes and solutions are correct","An excellent uunderstanding \nof the processes involved  \nwhen conducting  data  \nanalysis in python. \nData importing, \npre-processing and \ndescriptive statistics have \nall bene completed. \nCorrect coding onventions  \nhave been applied.  \nProcesses are correct","A very good understanding  of most of the processes  involved when conducting \n data analysis in python \nData importing,  pre-processing and  descriptive statistics have  \nall been completed. \nCoding conventions have been applied. \nProcesses are mostly correct.","A satisfactory understanding  of most processes involved when conducting data  \nanalysis in python. \nSome data importing, pre-processing and descriptive statistics have  \n been completed. \nCoding conventions have been mostly applied. \nSome processes are correct and justified","Insuffucient understanding  \nof the processes involved  when conducting data  \nanalysis in python \nData importing,  \npre-processing and  descriptive statistics have  \nbeen insufficiently completed. \nInsufficent coding conventions have \nbeen applied. \nProcesses and solutions have been given, yet insufficiently correct.",Underdeveloped understanding  \nof the processes involved  when conducting data \nanalysis in python. \nUnderdeveloped pre-processing and statistical investigation. \nUnderdeveloped coding conventions have been applied and underdeveloped \nprocesses are evident.,Minimal understanding  \nof the processes involved  when conducting data \nanalysis in python. \nMinimal pre-processing and  \nstatistical investigation. \nMinimal coding conventions have been applied and minimal \nprocesses are evident.,No understanding  \nof the processes involved  \nwhen conducting data analysis in python. \nNo pre-processing and  statistical investigation have  \nbeen undertaken. \nNo coding conventions have been applied and minimal \nprocesses are evident.
Task 1.2 Reflective report,30,Exemplary report demonstrating knowledge and judgement of python processes within a data science environment,"An outstanding report.  \nAll analysis results  \nhave been given and are correct, therefore inferring  the correct data analysis methodologies. \nAll results are fully reasoned and justified. No gaps are  shown within the analysis","An excellent report \nAnalysis results  \nhave been given and are correct, therefore inferring  \nthe appropriate data  analysis methodologies. \nResults are reasoned and \njustified.","A very good report.  \nMost analysis results have  been given, therefore mostly inferring some form of data \nanalysis methodology. \nMost of the results are reasoned  and justified. \nMinor gaps are shown within the analysis.","A satisfactory report.  \nSome analysis results have been given, therefore inferring some form of data analysis methodology. \nSome of the results are \nreasoned  and justified. \nGaps are shown within  some of the analysis.","Insufficient analysis.  Results \nhave been given, yet incorrect. \nSome of the results are reasoned   \nand justified, but incorrect. \nFrequent gaps are shown  within the analysis","An underdeveloped analysis.  Results \nhave been given, yet underdeveloped. \nSome of the results are reasoned with    \nand justified, but underdeveloped. \nFrequent gaps are shown  within an underdeveloped analysis","A minimal analysis has been given.  Minimal results given, yet incorrect. \nMinimal results have been reasoned with \nand justified, but on the whole, incorrect. \nMultiple gaps are shown  within the analysis",No analysis has been given.  No results given. \nNo results have been reasoned with \nor justified.  Major gaps throughout the submission
